* Start the app

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can :

## Start

- To start the app run `npm start-dev`. It restarts app when changes are made to the source code

## Test

- Server side testing is done through the use of `supertest`, `mocha` and `chai` packages. `supertest` is used to make requests to the api and `mocha` is the testing framework and `chai` is the assertion library. They will both be installed when you run `npm install` and the tests will run when you run `npm test`.
- Run `npm test` or `npm run test`

- Client side testing is done through the use of `Enzyme`,  `Jest` and `NightWatch` packages. They will be installed when you run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run test:client` for Front End test
- Run `npm run e2e-test` for End-to-End test

  
``Note:`` Before trying to run the end to end test you need to do the following:

  1. [Download Selenium](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.8/selenium-server-standalone-3.9.1.jar)
  1. Download a webdriver, for our case we will be using the [chrome webdriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.35/). For more info on how to use other webdriver please visit this [link](http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted#browser-drivers-setup)
  1. Extract the files you just downloaded
  1. Create a folder with the name ``bin``
  in the root directory for the project
  1. Move the extracted files into the ``bin`` folder
  1. Start the server
  1. You can now run the end to end test command.



# Authentication

- It uses JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication.
- Token is generated at sign up
- Token gets verified each time user interact with the    application
- Admin user will be created when you run seed
